								<h2>The Problem</h2>
								<p>Existing environmental health maps are slow, difficult to use, and lack sufficient data. The goal of this project is to develop a design for an environmental health map of the U.S. that anyone can use to see environmental factors in their community. </p>
							</header>
							<header class="major">
								<h2>Constraints and the Task</h2>
								<p>This project was highly constrained by time. My work has been developing sketches for the site and preparing them for user testing. These tests will inform future design of the product, establishing which design styles to create hi-fi prototypes of and conduct usability tests on.</p>

								<h2>Design 1</h2>
								<p>Design 1 has the map take up the entire screen, with boxes on the side containing the checkboxes for different layers. Testing on this design will demonstrate user interest in a map which covers the entire browser window.</p>
							</div>
						</section>
						<section class="spotlight">
							<div class="image"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
								<h2>Design 2</h2>
								<p>Design 2 has the map only be a small square window next to background information. This tests how much users favor background information and clear options but a smaller map window.</p>
							</div>
						</section>
						<section class="spotlight">
							<div class="image"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
								<h2>Design 3 (1/2)</h2>
								<p>Design 3 has the map take up the entire screen but the options are hidden under a dropdown menu. This allows users to see the map unobscured on the entire screen, but it may be unintuitive to select filters.</p>

								<h2>User testing</h2>
								<p>I intentionally used very rough sketches to conduct user testing to encourage more honest feedback. Users will be asked to explain completing a different task for each interface, and their actions and speed will be recorded, though speed will only be measured across attempt order (first attempts with other first attempts, ect.). After the task, users will be asked the following questions:</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li>
									<p>What did you think of the interface?</p>
								</li>
								<li >
									<p>What did you think of the layout of the content?</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>What was the best thing about using this site?</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>What was the worst thing about using this site?</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>How would you improve the interface?</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>How would you rate using this interface out of 10?</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<header class="major">
								<h2>Future Work</h2>
								<p>The results of the early user testing will inform future design of this project. I  plan to build hi-fidelity prototypes of the most successful designs and conduct a series of usability tests to converge on a final design. The complete process will entail a few more stages of prototyping and testing.</p>
